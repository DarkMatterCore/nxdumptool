todo:

    title: always retrieve names from unpacked nacps? (e.g. if an update changes the name of a title, like deltarune)
    title: use dlc index as part of the output dump filename?
    title: more functions for title lookup? (filters, patches / aoc, etc.)
    title: more functions for content lookup? (based on id)
    title: parse the update partition from gamecards (if available) to generate ncmcontentinfo data for all update titles

    usb: change buffer size?
    usb: change chunk size?
    usb: improve abi (make it rest-like?)
    usb: improve cancel mechanism

    others: check todo with grep
    others: dump verification via no-intro
    others: fatfs browser for emmc partitions

reminder:

list of top level functions designed to alter nca data in order of (possible) usage:

    out of dump loop:
        * ncaSetDownloadDistributionType (instead of always using it like legacy, offer it as an option)

        * ncaRemoveTitlekeyCrypto (can be used with digital titles + game updates in gamecards)

        * nacpGenerateNcaPatch (Control)
            * calls romfsGenerateFileEntryPatch
                * calls ncaGenerateHierarchicalSha256Patch / ncaGenerateHierarchicalIntegrityPatch

        * ncaEncryptHeader (doesn't modify anything per se, but it's used to generate new encrypted header data if needed)

    inside dump loop:
        * cnmtGenerateNcaPatch (Meta)
            * calls pfsGenerateEntryPatch
                * calls ncaGenerateHierarchicalSha256Patch
            * returns true if cnmt needs no patching
            * demands an immediate ncaEncryptHeader call

        * ncaIsHeaderDirty (doesn't modify anything per se, but it's used to check if any of the functions above has been used, basically - and by extension, if the functions below need to be used)

        * ncaWriteEncryptedHeaderDataToMemoryBuffer (write encrypted nca header data)

        * cnmtWriteNcaPatch (writes cnmt patch)
            * calls pfsWriteEntryPatchToMemoryBuffer
                * calls ncaWriteHierarchicalSha256PatchToMemoryBuffer

        * nacpWriteNcaPatch (writes nacp patch)
            * calls romfsWriteFileEntryPatchToMemoryBuffer
                * calls ncaWriteHierarchicalSha256PatchToMemoryBuffer / ncaWriteHierarchicalIntegrityPatchToMemoryBuffer

        * cnmtUpdateContentInfo (used to update content entry info in the raw cnmt copy after dumping each one - ignores the current content if its a meta nca)
